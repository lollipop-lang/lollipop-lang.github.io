# Lollipop Language

Lollipop Language, also referred to as Lol-lang, is a modern computing language designed for implementing and using serverless functions on the web.

First conceptualized in 2016, it was inspired by Unix pipe-style commands and originally designed under the name Dexy-Lang to make programming accessible to anyone. However, its development was halted after the initial launch, and it is currently being planned for a rebirth under a new name.

The goal of this language is to allow anyone to easily program without understanding the underlying structure of web services, and to operate it in a Serverless environment without building a server. Moreover, while maintaining the basic structure of the language, it aims to enable natural language-based programming through the user's native language by integrating with AI, and to instantly check the results on the web.

To reliably operate user-implemented functions in Serverless, it implements a distributed processing system based on the Erlang VM, which is optimized for high availability. It also uses a Pluggable structure to allow anyone to develop and share underlying functions - a feature already implemented in Dexy-Lang.
